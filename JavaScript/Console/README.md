# JavaScript and the Console

- JavaScript is a client-side scripting language. When the browser loads the page, the browser has a built-in interpreter that reads the JavaScript code it finds in the page and runs it.

### The Console

- The Console can be used to log information as part of the JavaScript development process, as well as allow you to interact with a web page by carrying out JavaScript expressions within the page's context. Essentially, the Console provides you with the ability to write, manage, and monitor JavaScript on demand.

### console.log() 

- console.log() is a built in method in JS to write a message to the console. This is mostly used for testing purposes.

```js
    console.log("Hello Word");
```

- You can put in any data type inside the paranthesis.
- We use this as a part of the debugging process so that we know exactly what data we are dealing with.
